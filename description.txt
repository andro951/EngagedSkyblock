Engaged Skyblock is about staying Engaged while playing Skyblock instead of waiting for things to happen or doing the exact same thing for coutless hours.

Note: Everything from this mod is only active on worlds with one of the skyblock seeds shown below.

How do I make a Skyblock world?
	The Seeds:
		skyblock
		fortheworthyskyblock

	Use one of the seeds.  fortheworthyskyblock starts you with the same skyblock, but has the vanilla fortheworthy settings while playing.  (Tree bombs Beware)

Engaged Features
	-Speedy Growth: Trees/Grass/etc grow faster when a player (that is running/moving fast/jumping) is nearby.  (Similar to Twerking for trees from Minecraft)
	-Mud to Clay:   Mud blocks with an empty tile above and not within 4 blocks of water (connected by mud or dirt) will dry out and turn into clay blocks.
	-Hammers:       Hammers work as pickaxes (When holding right click).  Breaking blocks with a hammer has different effects than pickaxes:
		-Wood -> Wood Chips
		-Stone -> Sand
	-Liquids:		Water and Lava combining mechanics changed.
		-Infinite Stone and Silt Generator: If a water block and lava block are seperated by 1 block of air, stone (or silt 20%) will be generated between 
			them with no loss of liquids.
		-Liquids combining in other ways will create stone, silt or obsidian depending on how much lava is combined.
			-90% of a lava block = obsidian
			-25% to 90% of a lava block = silt
			-0% to 25% of a lava block = stone

	-Extra Extractinator Recipes:
		-Wood Chips -> Sap, and bugs
		-Sand -> Silt and 


	-Recipes
		Mud Block: [Sink] 1 Dirt Block + 1 Hay Block (Vanilla allows 1 Dirt Block for 1 Mud Block at a sink)
		Silt Block: [Furnace] 1 Sand Block + 1 Clay Block

	-NPC drops
		Slimes: Acorns (5%), Grass Seeds (2%), Jungle Grass Seeds (2%)

Progression Tips
	-Liquids can be duplicated if done correctly.  (3:30 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLBMZyBfQXE)
	-Making a sink consumes a bucket of water, be careful!
