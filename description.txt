Engaged Skyblock is about staying Engaged while playing Skyblock instead of waiting for things to happen or doing the exact same thing for coutless hours.
It focuses on building and automation.  The starting world is a tiny island with a tree and a chest with a bucket of water and lava.  The rest of the world is empty.

Note: Everything from this mod is only active on worlds with one of the skyblock seeds shown below.

How do I make a Skyblock world?
	The Seeds:
		skyblock
		fortheworthyskyblock

	Use one of the seeds.  fortheworthyskyblock starts you with the same skyblock, but has the vanilla fortheworthy settings while playing.  (Tree bombs Beware)

Engaged Features
	-Speedy Growth: Trees/Grass/etc grow faster when a player (that is running/moving fast/jumping) is nearby.  (Similar to Twerking for trees from Minecraft)
	-Leaves: Breaking/Shaking trees spawns Leaf Blocks [i:192] which can be used to craft dirt blocks.
	-Dirt [i:133] to Mud [i:176]: Dirt that is directly touching water or mud that has a path to water (10 block radius from water), or open to the sky while raining will turn to mud.
	-Mud [i:176] to Dirt [i:133]: Mud blocks not touching water or mud that has a path to water or open the the sky while raining will dry out to dirt.
	-Hardened Sand [i:3272][i:3274][i:3275][i:3338]: Sand blocks with 4 blocks above it that can fall like sand/silt can randomly turn to hardened sand.
	-Desert Fossils [i:3347]: Organic blocks that are burred (covered on all 4 sides) in a desert will eventually turn into desert fossils.
		-Conversion chances: Bone blocks(20%), Poo(10%), glowing mushroom(4%), cactus(1.5%), bamboo(1.5%), pumpkin(1.5%), hay(1%), leaf block(0.5%), wood(0.1%)

	-Hammers: Hammers work as pickaxes (When holding right click).  Breaking blocks with a hammer has different effects than pickaxes.
		-Wood [i:9] -> Wood Chips (Wood Chips are grab bags that drop acorns [i:27] and bugs [i:3192] [i:3193] [i:3194])
		-Stone [i:3] -> Sand [i:169]
		-Snow Block [i:593] -> Ice Block [i:664] (Requires having 1 snow block on top of another and converts the 2 blocks into 1 ice block)

	-Liquids: Water [i:206] and Lava [i:207] combining mechanics changed.
		-Infinite Stone [i:3] and Silt [i:424] Generator: If a water block and lava block are separated by 1 block of air, stone (or silt 20%) will be generated between 
			them with no loss of liquids.
		-Water  [i:206] and Lava [i:207] combining in other ways will create stone [i:3], silt [i:424] or obsidian [i:173] depending on how much lava is combined.
			-90% of a lava block [i:207] = obsidian [i:173]
			-25% to 90% of a lava block [i:207] = silt [i:424]
			-0% to 25% of a lava block [i:207] = stone [i:3]

	-Liquids On blocks:
		-Sand [i:169] that is touched by lava [i:207] will turn to sandstone [i:3271] after a short delay.
		-Snow [i:593] that is touched by water [i:206] will turn to slush [i:1103] after a short delay.
		-Granite [i:3086] that is touched by water [i:206] and lava [i:207] at the same time will turn to marble [i:3081] after a short delay.
		-Hay [i:1727] that is touched by lava [i:207] will turn to ash [i:172] after a short delay.
		-Ash [i:172] that is touched by water [i:206] will turn to clay [i:133] after a long delay.

	-Spreading Ice [i:664]: Water [i:206] that is being touched by ice [i:664] on 2 sides will turn to ice after a short delay.

	-Snowball storm: Snowballs [i:949] will fall from the sky when it is snowing if a Rain Totem is placed in the world.  Snow will happen at high altitudes
		(Between the top 1/5  of the world and space in any biome besides the desert when raining.)
		(Snowballs [i:949] can be used to make snow blocks and deal minor damage to enemies.)

	-Rain Totem: Makes rain 10 times more likely when placed in the world.  (Also makes snowballs [i:949] fall if snowing.)

	-Spiders: Placing bugs [i:3194] in a chest [i:48] will slowly consume the bugs to convert nearby walls to spider walls.
		(Only converts walls when no players can see the chest and block being converted.) "Silk is nice, but is it worth the price?"

	-Chlorophyte [i:947]: 1 chlorophyte ore tries to spawn by replacing a mud [i:176]/jungle grass [i:195] block when Wall of Flesh is killed for the first time.
		Also has an extremely low chance of converting a mud [i:176] tile surrounded by mud [i:176] or jungle grass [i:195] on all sides.
		Chlorophyte is now allowed to spread anywhere instead of only underground, but has a reduced spread rate above ground (same as remix world seed)

	-Extra Extractinator [i:997] Recipes:
		Demonite [i:56]/Crimtane [i:880]: Silt [i:424]/Slush [i:1103]/Desert Fossils [i:3347] have a small chance to drop Demonite [i:56]/Crimtane [i:880] depending on the world evil type.
		Life Crystal [i:29]: 1% from Desert Fossils [i:3347]

	-Recipes
		Dirt Block [i:]: [i:192] 1 Leaf Block + [i:424] 1 Silt Block

		Dungeon Bricks [i:134] [i:137] [i:139]: 40 stone [i:3] + 10 obsidian [i:173] + 1 dye [i:1015] to make the 50 dungeon bricks [i:134] of the matching color.

		Unsafe Dungeon Walls [i:5365] [i:5371] [i:5368]: Heavy Workbench [i:2172] 1 Dungeon Brick [i:134] [i:137] [i:139] after Skeletron is defeated.

	-Signs
		Signs [i:171] can be used to move some locations in the game by writing the associated keyword on the sign.
			-World Spawn pont: "Spawn"  (Requires a tile that you can stand under the left side of the sign and no solid tiles or liquids in the 2x3 space above the floor)
			-Dungeon (Old Man and Lunatic Cultist spawn point): "Dungeon" (Requires a dungeon tile brick under the left side of the sign, no solid tile 7 tiles above 
				the dungeon brick, and 10 solid blocks on either side of the brick for spawning the cultists)

Progression Tips
	-Liquids can be duplicated if done correctly.  (3:30 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLBMZyBfQXE)
	-Making a sink [i:2827] consumes a bucket of water [i:206], be careful!
