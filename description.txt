Engaged Skyblock is about staying Engaged while playing Skyblock instead of waiting for things to happen or doing the exact same thing for coutless hours.

Note: Everything from this mod is only active on worlds with one of the skyblock seeds shown below.

How do I make a Skyblock world?
	The Seeds:
		skyblock
		fortheworthyskyblock

	Use one of the seeds.  fortheworthyskyblock starts you with the same skyblock, but has the vanilla fortheworthy settings while playing.  (Tree bombs Beware)

Engaged Features
	-Speedy Growth: Trees/Grass/etc grow faster when a player (that is running/moving fast/jumping) is nearby.  (Similar to Twerking for trees from Minecraft)
	-Mud to Clay: Mud blocks with an empty tile above and not within 4 blocks of water (connected by mud or dirt) will dry out and turn into clay blocks.
	-Hardening Sand: Sand blocks with 4 blocks above it that can fall like sand/silt can randomly turn to hardened sand.
	-Desert Fossils: Organic blocks that are burred (covered on all 4 sides) in a desert will eventually turn into desert fossils.
		-Conversion chances: Bone blocks(20%), Poo(10%), glowing mushroom(4%), Living tree leaves(2%), cactus(1.5%), bamboo(1.5%), pumpkin(1.5%), hay(1%), wood (0.1%)
	-Hammers: Hammers work as pickaxes (When holding right click).  Breaking blocks with a hammer has different effects than pickaxes:
		-Wood -> Wood Chips
		-Stone -> Sand
		-Snow Block -> Ice Block (Requires having 1 snow block on top of another and converts the 2 blocks into 1 ice block)
	-Liquids: Water and Lava combining mechanics changed.
		-Infinite Stone and Silt Generator: If a water block and lava block are separated by 1 block of air, stone (or silt 20%) will be generated between 
			them with no loss of liquids.
		-Water and Lava combining in other ways will create stone, silt or obsidian depending on how much lava is combined.
			-90% of a lava block = obsidian
			-25% to 90% of a lava block = silt
			-0% to 25% of a lava block = stone
	-Liquids On blocks:
		-Sand that is touched by lava will turn to sandstone after a short delay.
		-Ice touching water on 2 sides will turn the water to ice.
		-Snow that is touched by water will turn to slush after a short delay.
		-Granite that is touched by water and lava at the same time will turn to marble after a short delay.
		-Hay that is touched by water and honey at the same time will turn to ash after a short delay.

	-Spreading Ice: Water that is touching ice on 2 sides will turn to ice after a short delay.

	-Snowball storm: Snowballs will fall from the sky when it is snowing if a Rain Totem is placed in the world.  Snow happens at high altitudes
		(Between the top 1/5  of the world and space in any biome besides the desert when raining.)
		(Snowballs can be used to make snow blocks and deal minor damage to enemies.)

	-Rain Totem: Makes rain 10 times more likely when placed in the world.  (Also makes snowballs fall if snowing.)

	-Extra Extractinator Recipes:
		Silt/Slush/Desert Fossils have a small chance to drop Demonite/Crimtane depending on the world evil type.

	-Recipes
		Mud Block: [Sink] 1 Dirt Block + 1 Hay Block (Vanilla allows 1 Dirt Block for 1 Mud Block at a sink)
		Silt Block: [Furnace] 1 Sand Block + 1 Clay Block
		Snow Block: [None] 15 snowballs

	-NPC drops
		Slimes: Acorns (5%), Grass Seeds (2%), Jungle Grass Seeds (2%)

Progression Tips
	-Liquids can be duplicated if done correctly.  (3:30 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLBMZyBfQXE)
	-Making a sink consumes a bucket of water, be careful!
